# Fenced code blocks
You can create fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks ``` before and after the code block. We recommend placing a blank line before and after code blocks to make the raw formatting easier to read.
```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
# Creating a table
You can create tables with pipes | and hyphens -. Hyphens are used to create each column's header, while pipes separate each column. You must include a blank line before your table in order for it to correctly render.


| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

# Writing mathematical expressions
To include a math expression inline with your text, delimit the expression with a dollar symbol $.

This sentence uses `$` delimiters to show math inline:  $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$

To add a math expression as a block, start a new line and delimit the expression with two dollar symbols $$.

**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**

$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$
